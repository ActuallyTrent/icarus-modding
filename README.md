This is the home of my work on modding Icarus.

You can find me on Discord as `FAQ#4661`

The modding community for Icarus appears to be mostly gathered in the Linkarus discord. [Join the discussion!](https://discord.gg/2UrWDXjxUk)

# Mods

Currently I only have one mod and it uses UnrealModLoader to function. It consists of debug tools I'll be using while developing other mods for Icarus.

You can find my UML mods and their installation instructions [here](UML/README.md)
