# Introduction

This portion of the repo consists of mods you can load with [Unreal Mod Loader](https://github.com/RussellJerome/UnrealModLoader/releases)

## Setup

The basic steps to getting UML working with Icarus is as follows:

1. Download UML.
2. Download the Icarus profile from this repo. It's located in the same directory as this README under the name `Icarus-Win64-Shipping.profile`. 
3. Copy the profile UMLs `Profiles` folder.
4. Navigate to your Icarus installation, and find the `Paks` folder.
   1. An example path would be `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Icarus\Icarus\Content\Paks`
5. In the `Paks` folder, create a folder called `LogicMods` if one is not already present.
6. Copy any UML mod `.pak` file to the `LogicMods` folder.
7. Start UML
8. Start Icarus
9. Happy modding!

There's only one mod available here, and it's the home of the soon to be many debug tools I find useful when working on a mod.

Current features are:

* Display the player's X/Y/Z coordinates on the top left of the window.
